# Mini JavaScript Projects

These mini javascript projects demonstrate that you do not always need javascript libraries/frameworks in order to create interactive sites. As long as you have solid understanding of javascript language and DOM manipulation, you can make small sites with great user interactions.

Furthermore, you can definitely improve your understanding of js libraries and frameworks by making mini projects using only vanilla javascript.
