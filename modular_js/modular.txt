modular js points
1. separation of concerns 
    => separate js into modules whose functionalities overlap as little as possible
2. memory management
    => no memory leak
    => unbound events 
3. efficient DOM manipulation
    => very few selectors
4. DRY
5. self-contained module
    => no global var
    => everything related to a module should be in the module
    => if a module manages more than one thing => split up
